## **Purpose**

  * There are few missing data in the files. what does the empty coulumns mean (Undocumented or Missing) ?
  
  * There is no proper description whether the data is missing or is it unknown.
  
  * There is no clear details about the temparature recorded (whether the temparatur eis reocorded in degree Celsuis or   Fahrenheit).
  
  * There is no proper indication about the purpose coloumn Chla in the files (zoo - temp.csv and zoo-temp-main.csv)
  
  * The coloumn which represents the "DEPTH" is not consistent over the three given datasets.
  
  * What does the coloumn "z" in the pond2010.csv file mean?
  
  * What is methodology used to determine the values obtained ? Has the methodology used to measure remained same over the years the studies were conducted ?
