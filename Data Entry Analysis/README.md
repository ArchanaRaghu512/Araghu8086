# Data Entry Analysis

> **For this Data Entry Analysis assignment, there are three files (form of .csv files) which were part of a study of distribution of two types of zooplanktons during day and night through many years.**

> **The current files/datasets provided have a number of issues which are :**

  * **There are few missing data in the files. What do those empty coloumns mean (Undocumented or Missing) ?**
  
  * **There are no details realted to the highlighted data.**
  
  * **There is no field to determine whether the recordings of the distribution were done during the day or night.
  
  * **There is no clear details about the temparature recorded (whether the temparature is reocorded in degree Celsuis or   Fahrenheit).**
  
  * **There is no proper indication about the purpose coloumn Chla in the files (_zoo - temp.csv and zoo-temp-main.csv_)**
  
  * **The coloumn which represents the "DEPTH" is not consistent over the three given datasets.**
  
  * **What does the coloumn "z" in the _pond2010.csv_ file mean?**
  
  * **What is methodology used to determine the values obtained ? Has the methodology used to measure remained same over the years the studies were conducted ?**
