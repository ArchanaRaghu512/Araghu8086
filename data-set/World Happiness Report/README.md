> The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. 
  The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. 
  The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors:
  **economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity**,
  contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in **Dystopia**, a hypothetical country 
  that has values equal to the worldâ€™s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. 
  They have noimpact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher 
  than others.

# Questions
